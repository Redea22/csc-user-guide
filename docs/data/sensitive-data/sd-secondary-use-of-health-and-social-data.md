The secondary use of health and social data means that the customer and register data created during health and social service sector activities **will be used for purposes other than the primary reason** for which they were originally saved.

## Data permit

Before using CSC's Sensitive Data services for secondary use, **you need to have a data permit**. There is two permit options:

* [Permit from Findata](findata-permit.md)
* [Permit from single public register](./single-register-permit.md)


## Available services for secondary use

### Restricted SD Desktop

SD Desktop is a service that allows you to use virtual desktop (i.e. virtual machine) from your web browser. With the virtual desktop, you can **access and analyse** authorised datasets. SD Desktop for secondary use is a restricted version from standard SD Desktop. It is certified for data processing under the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data. [Read more about restricted SD Desktop](sd-desktop-audited.md).

!!! Note

    * All data (incl. research groupâ€™s own data, scripts, programs) must be transferred to the computing environment through the data controller. SD Connect is not available for secondary use.

    * If you need a software that is not available on the Desktop as a default, please contact [Service Desk](../../support/contact.md) *(Subject: Sensitive Data)* well in advance - even before applying for a data permit.

    * Export of the results must be requested from the service desk and all exported data will be approved by the data permit authority.

### SD Apply

SD Apply is a service for **applying access rights** to sensitive datasets. It is a simple web user interface that guides you during the application process. If you have received a permit from a single register, you need to use SD Apply for applying access to the data. After the application process is completed, the data will be available in the restricted SD Desktop service.
