# Secondary use of health and social data

## What is secondary use of healt and social data
The secondary use of health and social data means that the customer and register data created during health and social service sector activities **will be used for purposes other than the primary reason** for which they were originally saved.

## Data permit

Before using CSC's Sensitive Data services for secondary use, **you need to have a data permit**. There is two permit options:

* [Permit from Findata](findata-permit.md)
* [Permit from single public register](sd-desktop-audited.md)


## Available services for secondary use

### Restricted SD Desktop

SD Desktop is a service that allows you to use virtual desktop (i.e. virtual machine) from your web browser. With the virtual desktop, you can access and analyse authorised datasets. SD Desktop for secondary use is a restricted version from standard SD Desktop. It is certified for data processing under the Act on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data. [Read more about restricted SD Desktop](sd-derktop-audited.md).


### SD Apply

SD Apply is a service for applying access rights to sensitive datasets. You need to use SD Apply, if your data permit is from [single public register](sd-desktop-audited.md). In practice, it is a simple web user interface that guides you during the application process. After your application process is completed, the data will be available in SD Desktop service.
